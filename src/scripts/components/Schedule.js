                                                After attending the Giant Conference I came away with a few key takeaways and eye opening points.  There are 2 parts of the presentation:  People are Hard (Understanding Users) & In a World of Hammers (Principles & Strategies).  Both parts explore the complicated world of UI / UX.

                                                Talk about the importance and value of regularly speaking with users to better understand their problems and solutions. This habit is the key to unlocking new product innovations and improvements that will actually make a difference in your customers lives.

                                                In this talk, we will go over how to build products and test ideas in a one week sprint.  Starting with a problem statement on Monday and finishing with one on one interviews on Friday we will go over all the benefits of using this method to get started with your next project.

                                                <hr />
                                                Serverless is one of those new buzzwords that everyone seems to be throwing around. Is it really going to kill all other computing architectures? Is it just a new trend that will soon fade away and is not worth your time to learn? In this talk we will see what serverless architecture is, why it developed, and what problems it is intended to solve. It is important for all software developers to have a basic understanding of serverless computing because all major cloud providers (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft) are rolling out their own flavors of serverless architecture, and major tech companies are turning to the model to power various parts of the tech stack.
                                                <br /><br />
                                                We will sample the power and convenience of serverless computing by developing a simple web application using AWS Lambda functions and a few other AWS services. We will see how Lambda is able to completely eliminate the need for explicitly defined and managed server instances. Finally, we will see how to utilize a platform like Serverless (https://serverless.com/) to remove your applicationâ€™s dependence on a single cloud provider.

                                                <hr />
                                                One of the most difficult things to do as a developer is to stop over engineering a process because of a possible future use. In this talk I will provide tips to avoid complicating the code base on the possibility of future changes while at the same time writing code which is open for extension.

                                                Kuberetes is an container orchestration technology that can help you deliver services to your users faster and more robustly. Home has been leveraging kubernetes to develop and run micro services .  Kubernetes ecosystem is full of terminology and jargon but it still uses the same ways we been shipping software for years. We will go over how to get started with running containers to going to production with kubernetes.

                                                With its simple design, Go has quickly become one of the top system level programming languages. From Docker to Syncthing, there are all kinds of cool open source projects being built in Go. Go is a relatively easy language to learn, but it can be difficult to know where to start especially if you come from a background of interpreted or dynamically typed languages.  In this talk we will introduce the basic language syntax and features as well as the tools that make learning the language easier.

                                                Going to discuss how to survive as a QA Engineer in an agile environment. This will cover the top 5 Best QA Practices in an agile environment. It will be educational for both QAs AND Devs, sort of a "Can we all just get along" angle. How we work together and Support each other is  extremely important to achieving the best possible code release results. This will be an interactive session that I believe everyone will get a lot out of. My mentor, Dave Haeffner, took me down this road a few years ago and I have never looked back.

                                                As of March 2017, most modern browsers fully support the new CSS display type, Grid.  An easy and intuitive way make beautifully simple and exotically elaborate layouts on websites.  No more Bootstrap columns.  No more resource guzzling JavaScript.  Make resource friendly and responsive web applications with just a few quick lines of CSS.

                                                CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model for general computing on GPUs. In GPU-accelerated applications, the sequential part of the workload runs on the CPU- which is optimized for single-threaded performance- while the compute intensive portion of the application runs on thousands of GPU cores in parallel. When using CUDA, developers program in popular languages such as C, C++, Fortran, Python and MATLAB and express parallelism  through extensions in the form of a few basic keywords.

                                                <hr />
                                                A year ago I agreed to take up a challenge to re-implement ForRentâ€™s Lead Insights data process. In this talk I will share the challenges I had and the lessons I learned using Apache Spark and Kafka to generate user insights for Leads (guest cards) submitted through the front-end website.
